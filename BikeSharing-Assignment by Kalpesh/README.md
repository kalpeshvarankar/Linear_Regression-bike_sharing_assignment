## General Information
A bike-sharing system is a public bike sharing service wherein bikes are made available for shared use to individuals for short term by either on rent basis or free. A US bike sharing provider BoomBikes has severely impacted by the corona pandemic. It is looking forward to come up with a mindful business plan to accelerate its revenue. The provider wants to know and understand what all factors are contributing significantly for the deman of their shared bikes.

## Conclusions
- Consider year: As seen from the variable-yr (year), one thing to notice here is that the demand for bike seems to be increasing drastically as the year passes. From the year 2018 to 2019, the demand of BoomBikes increased by almost 2000 units. More people are getting to know about the shared bikes and this may increase in comming years as well.

- Consider temperature:  Also, the temperature seems to be impacting the demand for shared bikes more which is very obvious because as the temperature or we can say when the weather is clear, more people will be using the BoomBikes.

- Consider weather: The demand for bikes or we can say that the provision of bikes for various users can be easily manipulated according to the weather conditions as well. For example- In clear weather, people tend to use shared bikes more, followed by mist weather. When the weather is little snowy or windy, very less amount of BoomBikes are used. Proving appropriate number of bikes on docking station would help in various factors like low maintainance, less chances of bikes getting damaged by weather conditions ultimately resulting in cost saving.

- Consider season: The season of spring has a negative impact on the use of BoomBikes. A good factor to understand and manage the supply of bikes for the company BoomBikes.

- Consider holidays and Sundays: Surprisingly, on the days off or on Sundays, people tend to use less shared bikes as it has a negative impact according to our predictions. This may be because people on holidays would like to use their own vehicles and travel along with their family and friends rather then using BoomBikes.
